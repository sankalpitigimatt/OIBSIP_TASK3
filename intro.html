I dream to lead a successful life. To lead a successful life it is very important to know where you are headed & what you want to achieve. Settings goals helps to make your dreams come true. I want to see myself stand out of the crowd & not like a tree that is swayed anywhere with the blowing wind.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">We all have various aims in life. Some of us chose to have a quiet life while some want to lead glamorous flashy lives. Not only us but our parents too have big dreams for us. They want to give us the best education & all comforts of life. But many few people actually makes their dreams comes true.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">Not everyone becomes an engineer, a doctor, a manager, a lawyer etc. because they fail to create a way to achieve their desires. I want to become a Engineer. My aim is to use my skills to make my country a better place to live.</p>

              <p class="paragraph">Everyone’s life is a different story. Some of us experience a lot of good happenings in life whereas others experience the exact opposite. But it is necessary for anyone to understand the fact that “life is full of joy, sorrow, ecstasy, difficulties, happiness, sorrow, victory, defeat etc. All of these elements are vital parts of a good life.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">So, I live my life to the fullest. Most people don’t like hurdles and difficulties but I do because they make me a better version of myself after I conquer them. As I have a problem-solving attitude, I like to solve maths. In fact, maths is the perfect example of assessing one’s problem-solving ability.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">We have different types of days in our lives, some are ordinary while some are special. There are some days that get etched in our memories forever. Likewise, I also have a memorable day of my life that is very dear to me. The memories of this day are engraved in my heart and will remain so forever.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">My tenth birthday is the most memorable day of my life. It is a day I can never forget and I consider it to be the best birthday yet. The day started just like any other normal day. However, as it kept progressing, a lot of exciting things began to happen.</p>

               <p class="paragraph"> I woke up very early on my birthday because I had to dress up in casual clothes for school. The day before, all my candies were ready that I would distribute in the classroom.</p>
                
               <p class="paragraph"> My mother prepared my favourite breakfast and gave me a big chocolate bar for lunch as well. I went to school and the whole class sang for me and congratulated me. It was the turn to distribute sweets.</p>
                
                <p class="paragraph">My best friend and I went to all the teachers to distribute toffees and we had a great time there. Moreover, it was an incredible feeling. My friends were all singing for me and eager to come to my birthday party later in the evening.</p>
